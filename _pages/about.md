I am a statistics professor at the University of Bonn.
My research is located in the field of mathematical statistics and theoretical econometrics. 
My main research interests are

* non- and semiparametric estimation 
* high-dimensional statistics
* clustering/classification 
* locally stationary time series 
* generalized additive models.

The statistical methods developed in my work can for example be applied to problems in economics, finance, biomedicine and climatology.
