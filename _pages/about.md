I am a statistics professor at the University of Bonn.
I work in the field of mathematical statistics and theoretical econometrics. 
My main research interests are 

* non- and semiparametric statistics 
* high-dimensional statistics
* clustering/classification 
* multiscale statistics 
* nonstationary time series, <br/>
  esp. locally stationary time series.
 
The statistical methods developed in my work can for example be applied to problems in economics, finance, biomedicine and climatology.
